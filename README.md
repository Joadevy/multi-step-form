## Welcome to my project: multi step form! ðŸ‘‹

Â» Live Site URL: https://multi-step-form-joadevy.vercel.app/

## Overview
Â» It's a solution for the [frontend mentor code challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ) that I did to practice my React abilities and at the same time to improve my handling of tailwind CSS and typescript.   
  This time I worked with a responsive formulary app when I had to implement different techniques to manage user's data and display several steps correctly. At the end I added a suit of unit tests to guarantee components works just fine.

Â» Technologies used in this challenge:
* React
* Typescript
* TailwindCSS
* Deployment on vercel
* Vite for startup the project
* Git
* Vitest & React Testing Library
